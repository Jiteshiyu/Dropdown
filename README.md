## Overview
This project is a simple and responsive dropdown menu built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu includes multiple dropdown links for sections such as About, Services, and Portfolio, allowing for a clean navigation experience. Each dropdown reveals additional sub-links upon hovering or clicking, enhancing user interaction.

## Features
- Responsive and dynamic dropdown functionality.
- Click event handling to display dropdown lists.
- Clicking outside the dropdown closes any open lists.
- Minimal, modern design with smooth animations and hover effects.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Markup language to structure the page.
- CSS3: Used for layout, style, and basic animations.
- JavaScript: Handles the dropdown toggle functionality.
  
## How It Works
- The header contains a navigation bar with multiple dropdown menus.
- When a user clicks on a dropdown menu, the sub-list appears.
- Clicking outside the dropdown closes any open lists.
